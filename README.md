### Project Description
The second project involves the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (KYTC). The goal of the project is to use real-time (within 5-30 seconds) images of highways in Louisville to give estimates on traffic density at a given time. We would use a machine learning program to process the images, classify the number of cars, and then send relevant data to a hosted website consisting of only a traffic map. We reached out to KYTC via their email, and were put in contact with ______ who told us that an internal discussion had been started and that they would reach out to us with further information. The goal of our contact with KYTC is to gain access via credentials and SFTP or through an API that would let our server download images of traffic to then be processed. In the worst case, we could use web scraping of these public images. To get an idea of what images we would use, a map can be accessed here:
