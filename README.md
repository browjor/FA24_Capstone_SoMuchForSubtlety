# 2024 Capstone Project Traffic Map

## Team Name: *So Much For Subtlety*
- John Brown
- Aaron O'Brien
- Mason Napper

### Project Description
The goal of our project is to use real-time (within 5-30 seconds) images of highways in Louisville to give estimates on traffic density at a given time. We would use a machine learning program to process the images, classify the number of cars, and then send relevant data to a hosted website consisting of only a traffic map.
