# Meeting Minutes

## 9/3/2024
Talk to sexton about tech stack on traffic project

Questions for sexton:

1. Is a digital ocean server appropriate for this level
		- any tips on setting it up?
		- "DO" said it was linux based, do i provide an OS or is there one already there?
		- could i access it with something like putty?

2. is flask a good option for this? it seemed mostly like a html server

### Actionables:
- send email to KYTC on thursday 9/5 clarifying our project

- send email to pittman on thursday 9/12 asking about a good zoom time

## 9/10/2024
Email sent to KYTC as planned

Talked about potential remote server costs, instead agreed to deploy a server on one of Mason's desktops

Desired specs for server would be 10-15 GB SSD (128 economical choice) and 8-16 GB RAM, with possible GPU assistance

Vercel still frontrunner for frontend hosting

Instead of direct KYTC server requests, web scraping may be better option for simplicity

For first report:
JB - Q1,2,7

MN - Q3,4

AB - Q5,6

#### Potential Future Issues:
Day/Night/Rain differences in training/prediction of yolov8 models

This could be solved by training models with particular weights for a particular camera to aid in prediction

### Actionables:
- write script to test if pulling images from urls is feasible

- look into running Python/Flask server on windows

- decide on which project to do
